## Running the Development Server

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `yarn` or `npm install`.
2. Start the server by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

That's it! You should now see the project running in your browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically be reloaded in the browser.
